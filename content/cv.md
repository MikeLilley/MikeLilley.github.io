<ul>
    <li><p>Create bespoke real-time machine vision software in Python and C++ deployed on Linux devices for automatic defect detection during various manufacturing processes.</p></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li><p>Led the software development of a system that visually inspects for various types of defects in sheet metal panels. This system was installed on press lines at three factories that each belong to major automotive OEMs, with defect outflow being reduced dramatically each time.</p></li>
        <li><p>Led the software development of a real-time quality checking system for laser-engraved vehicle headlamps, defect detection performance exceeded 99%.</p></li>
        <li><p>Participated in the creation of custom software for Matrox Iris GTX cameras, adding the capability to load in arbitrary custom ONNX model files to use for inference. </p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p>Create custom machine learning architectures centered on high-performance, both in accuracy and speed. </p></li>
    <li><p>Employ tools such as OpenCV, Scikit-Image, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn for image processing, data analysis, machine learning, and anomaly detection.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use Docker and Kubernetes for container orchistration, as well as ZeroMQ for inter-process and distributed communication.</p></li>
    <li><p>Parallelize data pipelines across many CPU cores and high-bandwidth distributed systems, as well as deploy on Nvidia hardware for accelerated processing capabilities.</p></li>
    <li><p>Deploy and manage SQL databases and web servers for KPI records.</p></li>

<ul>
    <li><p>Led a project which studied the application of concepts from computational topology to the problem of facial region segmentation, with our results later being published in IEEE ISM 2022; traveled solo to and gave a talk at the conference in Naples, Italy. (1)</p></li>
    <li><p>Used US congressional voting records to study graphical games in the context of game theory. Constructed and ran experiments to determine overall model fitness, analyzed the effects that pruning certain inputs had on the model, and determined if the behavior of a particular agent was better described by one model or another. (1)</p></li>
    <li><p>Regularly met with other students to assist them with coursework. Tutored up to 400-level mathematics and computer science courses, as well as introductory physics. (2)</p></li>
