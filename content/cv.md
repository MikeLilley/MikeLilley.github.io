### USS Vision, Inc.
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Position:</b> 
<ul>
    <li><p>Lead Machine Vision Engineer (1)</p></li>
    <li><p>Machine Vision Engineer (2)</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Location:</b> Livonia, MI, USA</p>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Dates of Employment</b>: 
<ul>
    <li>February 2024 - July 2024 (1)</li>
    <li>September 2021 - February 2024 (2)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Experience:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><p>I led the design and development of bespoke real-time vision inspection software for various manufacturing processes. Some examples include:</p></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li><p><a href="https://www.ussvision.com/post/in-line-split-detection">A pioneering defect detection system</a> for inspecting complex sheet metal panels (primarily car parts) originating from a large stamping press. Originally designed for detecting splits as small as one millimeter in the metal, the system has been expanded for verifying hole presence, as well as wrinkle and galling detection.
        <br/> With thirty GigE cameras, the system processes about sixty to ninety 12.3MP images every second, running the data through a custom-made processing pipeline which consists of both traditional signal processing algorithms as well as an ensemble of several machine learning models (vision transformers and variational autoencoders) that were developed in-house. <br/> This was a distributed system which required a significant amount of computation; the main processing engine included a multi-socket motherboard with several AMD EPYC processors, three Nvidia A100 GPUs, over 1 TB of RAM, and a 40 GiB/s NIC. This has been installed on five stamping presses belonging to various automotive OEMs with an average of a 10x reduction in outflow across all.</p></li>
        <li><p>A thermal imaging application to detect anomalies in lithium-ion battery temperature, alerting the factory to a potential fire or explosion hazard before it occurs. This uses several thermal cameras to rapidly inspect all parts of the battery as they move into an inspection station, with surface pixel error margins below 1Â°C.</p></li>
        <li><p>A quality checking system to inspect laser engravings on vehicle headlamps presented to the camera by a robotic arm. This required significant image preprocessing due to small variations within the presentation angle causing significant variation in the appearance of the engraved characters. As a result, several stages of non-linear contrast enhancement, thresholding, and morphological operations were applied based on parameters estimated from the measured intensity of the laser engravings before utilizing an OCR engine to verify the characters were correct.  </p></li>
        <li><p>For each system, we provided web dashboards on servers that we personally maintained in order for both our team and the client to view metrics and captured images stored in databases, as well as annotation tools for automated model training and feedback.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p>I traveled to manufacturing plants to contibute to the physical install of the systems as well as provide support and maintenance to existing systems.  </p></li>
</ul>



### University of Michigan - Dearborn
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Position:</b> 
<ul>
    <li><p>Research Assistant (1)</p></li>
    <li><p>Tutor (2)</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Location:</b> Dearborn, MI, USA</p>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Dates of Employment</b>: 
<ul>
<li>October 2020 - December 2022 (1)</li>
<li>March 2018 - April 2021 (2)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Experience:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><p>I led a project within the Affective Computing and Multimodal System Laboratory which studied the application of combining concepts from computational topology (specifically, simplicial homology) with feature descriptor algorithms such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform to the problem of facial region segmentation, with our results later being published in IEEE ISM 2022. I also traveled solo to and gave a talk at the conference in Naples, Italy.</p></li>
    <li><p>I contibuted to research within the Learning and Uncertainty in Intelligent
        Systems Laboratory. Using US congessional voting records, I studied graphical games 
        in the context of game theory. I constructed and ran experiments that compared 
        <a href="https://aaai.org/papers/7884-a-game-theoretic-approach-to-influence-in-networks/">linear influence games</a> to nonlinear influence games, analyzed the effects that pruning certain inputs had on 
        the models, and determined if the behavior of a particular agent was better described by one model or another. Furthermore, I participated in reading groups which studied
        novel algorithms for efficiently solving constraint satisfaction problems. </p></li>
    <li><p>I regularly met with other students to assist them with coursework. I tutored up to 400-level mathematics and computer science courses, as well as introductory calculus-based physics. (2)</p></li>
