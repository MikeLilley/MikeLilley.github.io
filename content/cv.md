<p><b>Dates of Employment</b>: September 2021 - Present</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Create bespoke real-time machine vision software in Python and C++ deployed on Linux devices for automatic defect detection during various manufacturing processes.</p></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li><p>Led the software development of a system that visually inspects for various types of defects in sheet metal panels. When installed on a major automotive OEM's stamping press line, defect outflow was reduced by 91.2%.</p></li>
        <li><p>Led the software development of a real-time quality checking system for laser-engraved vehicle headlamps, defect detection performance exceeded 99%.</p></li>
        <li><p>Participated in the creation of custom software for Matrox Iris GTX cameras, adding the capability to load in arbitrary custom ONNX model files to use for inference. </p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p>Create custom machine learning architectures centered on high-performance, both in accuracy and speed. </p></li>
    <li><p>Employ tools such as OpenCV, Scikit-Image, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn for image processing, data analysis, machine learning, and anomaly detection.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use Docker, Kubernetes, and Apache Kafka for container orchistration and inter-process communication.</p></li>
    <li><p>Parallelize data pipelines across many CPU cores and high-bandwidth distributed systems, as well as deploy on Nvidia hardware for accelerated processing capabilities.</p></li>
    <li><p>Deploy and manage SQL databases and web servers for KPI records.</p></li>
    <li><p>Interface with industrial hardware such as GigE cameras and programmable logic controllers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Serve as a technical contact for clients.</p></li>

### University of Michigan - Dearborn
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Position:</b> Research Assistant, Tutor</p>
<p style="margin:0;"><b>Location:</b> Dearborn, MI, USA</p>
<p><b>Dates of Employment</b>: October 2020 - Present (RA), March 2018 - April 2021 (Tutor)</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Led a project which studied the application of concepts from computational topology to the problem of facial region segmentation, with our results later being published in IEEE ISM 2022; traveled solo to and gave a talk at the conference in Naples, Italy. (RA)</p></li>
    <li><p>Used US congessional voting records to study graphical games in the context of game theory.
